  The Jaccard index, also known as the Jaccard similarity coefficient (originally coined coefficient de communaut√© by Paul Jaccard), is a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets.
  The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets."
